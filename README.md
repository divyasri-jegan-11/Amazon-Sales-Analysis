   - These categories account for 97% of the product variety and have the most customer reviews.
   - Electronics and Computers & Accessories also have the second and third highest rating counts.
   - Most customer reviews are submitted by anonymous users.

3. Customer Satisfaction
   - Overall Satisfaction: Most products are rated between 4 to 4.5 stars, reflecting high customer satisfaction.
   - Categories with the Highest Customer Satisfaction:

5. Price Prediction Model
     - A linear regression model was created to predict the discounted price from the actual price:
     - Discounted Price = 0.613 Ã— Actual Price â€“ 2.8
       Model Assumptions:
          - The model passed 2 out of 4 assumptions.
          - Heteroscedasticity and normality assumptions were violated, indicating:
               - Other variables may influence the discounted price.
               - Violation of the normality assumption may affect confidence intervals and statistical tests.
                 

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion
- Electronics and Home & Kitchen dominate both revenue and customer engagement, indicating these are key product categories for Amazon.
- Customer satisfaction is generally high, with most products receiving positive reviews.
- Discount patterns are consistent, with a majority of discounts ranging between 40% and 70%, making these categories highly attractive to customers.
- Although the linear regression model provides a good approximation for predicting discounted prices, further refinement is needed to meet all assumptions for accurate statistical inference.
